# dev-support

This folder contains resources intended to help metasfresh developers:
- all our eclipse config files
- intellij runConfigurations and other configs
- `application.properties` and other config files to set ports and stuff when running metasfresh parts locally
- docker-compose files to run "infrastructure" (postgresql, rabbitmq, elk-stack, etc.)
- a maven `settings.xml` file to access a maven repo with 3rd-party libs that are not found in maven-central
- helpful .sql files
