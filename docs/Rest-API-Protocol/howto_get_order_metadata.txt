For the start, i would suggest to check the following:

* create the window instance on server side: http://88.198.5.5:8081/rest/api/windows/openWindow/143
(i.e. AD_Window_ID=143 => that's the Sales Order window)

=> you will get the allocated WindowNo as response (e.g. 1)

* get the window metadata for WindowNo=1
http://88.198.5.5:8081/rest/api/windows/getViewRootPropertyDescriptor/1
=> you will get a huge JSON which describes what's inside that window
