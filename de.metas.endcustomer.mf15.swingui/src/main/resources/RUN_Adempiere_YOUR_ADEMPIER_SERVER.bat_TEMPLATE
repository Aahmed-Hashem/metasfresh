After having extracxted AdempiereClient.zip, you can place this file next to the Adempiere folder 
(scnr: don't forget to rename the file ending to ".bat" ^^).

SET OWN_FOLDER=%~dp0
SET PROPERTIES_FILE=%OWN_FOLDER%\adempiere_YOUR_ADEMPIERE_SERVER.properties

CALL %OWN_FOLDER%\Adempiere\RUN_Adempiere.bat %PROPERTIES_FILE%
